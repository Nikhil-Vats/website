# Contribute
 
Even considering the fact that Frictionless Data is a software community, you don't have to be a software developer to contribute. The first step to become a Frictionless Data contributor is to become a Frictionless Data user. You may use it as an "end-user," or as a developer of a library that relies on Data Packages, for instance. Once you start following the features, ideas for expansion will come easily.
 
## Issues

Report issues with projects in their own issue tracker, on GitHub. Doubts on where exactly? Drop us a line in [Gitter](https://gitter.im/frictionlessdata/chat). You may also decide to engage in existing issues and help other users. What if the issue is not a bug but a question? Please head to the [forum](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/forum/issues). It is an excellent place to give us thorough feedback about your experience as a whole. In the same way, you may participate in existing discussions and make your voice heard.
 
## Documentation 

Talking about getting yourself heard, we welcome contributions seeking to advocate and educate people in the data space. Given that we work on specifications and tools for a Frictionless Data experience, you may decide that [writing tutorials](./blog), [improving documentation](./docs), or even speaking at conferences is your favorite way of contributing. You don't have to ask permission to talk about Frictionless Data, but we love hearing when people tell us beforehand because we can try to help on sharing the news with a wider audience.
 
## Fund

Last, but not least, you may decide that you want to fund Frictionless Data with money. Please do it through donations to Open Knowledge International, in the name of the project, or contact us for commercial contracts.
